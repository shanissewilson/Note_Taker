# Description
This is my first attempt in coding a note taker. This note taker was mainly created with Express.js and JSON.
The note taker is designed to allow people to take notes as well as save them in order to be organized, schedule important events, as well as improve time management.

# How it runs
A user will open the Note_Taker app and will be taken to a landing page with a link to the notes page. Once landed on the notes page, the user will then be presented with previous notes on the left column, and access to right new notes on the right column. Once text is written in the empty new notes text box, a "Save Note" icon will appear. The user will then save the new note, and the new note will then moved to the saved or previous notes column on the left.
